        "Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\n",
        "Why does he talk again?\n",
        "Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.\n",
        "But it's our yogurt night!\n",
        "Bye-bye.\n",
        "Why is yogurt night so difficult?!\n",
        "You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!\n",
        "Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.\n",
        "Frosting...\n",
        "How many sugars?\n",
        "Just one. I try not to use the competition.\n",
        "So why are you helping me?\n",
        "Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.\n",
        "Those are great, if you're three.\n",
        "And artificial flowers.\n",
        "Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n",
        "Yeah, me too.\n",
        "Bent stingers, pointless pollination.\n",
        "Bees must hate those fake things!\n",
        "Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.\n",
        "Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.\n",
        "This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n",
        "I guess.\n",
        "You sure you want to go through with it?\n",
        "Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, \"Honey, I'm home,\" without paying a royalty!\n",
        "It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.\n",
        "What have we gotten into here, Barry?\n",
        "It's pretty big, isn't it?\n",
        "I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.\n",
        "You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?\n",
        "Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.\n",
        "What's the matter?\n",
        "I don't know, I just got a chill.\n",
        "Well, if it isn't the bee team.\n",
        "You boys work on this?\n",
        "All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.\n",
        "All right. Case number 4475,\n",
        "Superior Court of New York,\n",
        "Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.\n",
        "Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?\n",
        "A privilege.\n",
        "Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?\n",
        "I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.\n",
        "Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.\n",
        "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.\n",
        "If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.\n",
        "I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!\n",
        "Talking bee!\n",
        "How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?\n",
        "They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!\n",
        "Mr. Benson?\n",
        "Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.\n",
        "Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!\n",
        "I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!\n",
        "I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!\n",
        "Call your first witness.\n",
        "So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.\n",
        "I suppose so.\n",
        "I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!\n",
        "Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.\n",
        "Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.\n",
        "I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "I couldn't hear you.\n",
        "No.\n",
        "No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n",
        "They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n",
        "You mean like this?\n",
        "Bears kill bees!\n",
        "How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.\n",
        "So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?\n",
        "I was with a band called The Police.\n",
        "But you've never been a police officer, have you?\n",
        "No, I haven't.\n",
        "No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.\n",
        "Oh, please.\n",
        "Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n",
        "That's not his real name?! You idiots!\n",
        "Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.\n",
        "Thank you. Thank you.\n",
        "I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.\n",
        "I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n",
        "Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?\n",
        "Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!\n",
        "This isn't a goodfella.\n",
        "This is a badfella!\n",
        "Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!\n",
        "Order in this court!\n",
        "You're all thinking it!\n",
        "Order! Order, I say!\n",
        "Say it!\n",
        "Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n",
        "I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.\n",
        "Are we doing everything right, legally?\n",
        "I'm a florist.\n",
        "Right. Well, here's to a great team.\n",
        "To a great team!\n",
        "Well, hello.\n",
        "Ken!\n",
        "Hello.\n",
        "I didn't think you were coming.\n",
        "No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.\n",
        "I didn't want all this to go to waste,\n",
        "so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n",
        "Oh, that was lucky.\n",
        "There's a little left. I could heat it up.\n",
        "Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n",
        "So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby.\n",
        "That's where I usually sit. Right... there.\n",
        "Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n",
        "You think I don't see what you're doing?\n",
        "I know how hard it is to find the right job. We have that in common.\n",
        "Do we?\n",
        "Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n",
        "That's just what I was thinking about doing.\n",
        "Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n",
        "I'm going to drain the old stinger.\n",
        "Yeah, you do that.\n",
        "Look at that.\n",
        "You know, I've just about had it with your little Mind Games.\n",
        "What's that?\n",
        "Italian Vogue.\n",
        "Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n",
        "A lot of ads.\n",
        "Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine?\n",
        "Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here!\n",
        "I love the smell of flowers.\n",
        "How do you like the smell of flames?!\n",
        "Not as much.\n",
        "Water bug! Not taking sides!\n",
        "Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!\n",
        "This is pathetic!\n",
        "I've got issues!\n",
        "Well, well, well, a royal flush!\n",
        "You're bluffing.\n",
        "Am I?\n",
        "Surf's up, dude!\n",
        "Poo water!\n",
        "That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings!\n",
        "Kenneth! What are you doing?!\n",
        "You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it!\n",
        "We need to talk! He's just a little bee!\n",
        "And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n",
        "Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life?\n",
        " No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them!\n",
        "Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n",
        "My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster!\n",
        "Goodbye, Ken.\n",
        "And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man!\n",
        "I'm sorry about all that.\n",
        "I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it!\n",
        "I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it.\n",
        "Oh, well.\n",
        "Are you OK for the trial?\n",
        "I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas.\n",
        "We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n",
        "Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers...\n",
        "Yeah.\n",
        "Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over.\n",
        "Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees.\n",
        "You got the tweezers?\n",
        "Are you allergic?\n",
        "Only to losing, son. Only to losing.\n",
        "Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know.\n",
        "What exactly is your relationship to that woman?\n",
        "We're friends.\n",
        "Good friends?\n",
        "Yes.\n",
        "How good? Do you live together?\n",
        "Wait a minute... Are you her little... bedbug?\n",
        "I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children?\n",
        "Yeah, but...\n",
        "So those aren't your real parents!\n",
        "Oh, Barry...\n",
        "Yes, they are!\n",
        "Hold me back!\n",
        "You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson?\n",
        "He's denouncing bees!\n",

        "Objection!\n",
        "I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n",
        "Adam, don't! It's what he wants!\n",
        "Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit!\n",
        "Order! Order!\n",
        "The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way!\n",

        "I can't feel my legs.\n",
        "What Angel of Mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks?\n",

        "Yeah.\n",
        "I... I blew the whole case, didn't I?\n",
        "It doesn't matter. What matters is\n",
        "you're alive. You could have died.\n",
        "I'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n",
        "They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it.\n",
        "What was it like to sting someone?\n",
        "I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then...and then ecstasy!\n",
        "All right.\n",
        "You think it was all a trap?\n",
        "Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this.\n",

        "Yes? Yes, Your Honor!\n",
        "Where is the rest of your team?\n",
        "Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time.\n",
        "I actually heard a funny story about...\n",
        "Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on?\n",

        "It's a bee smoker!\n",
        "What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee.\n",
        "Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, \"Smoking or non?\" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps?\n",

        "What if Montgomery's right?\n",
        "What do you mean?\n",
        "We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years.\n",
        "Congratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement?\n",
        "First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps.\n",
        "Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop.\n",

        "What happened here?\n",
        "There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded.\n",
        "One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious!\n",
        "Is that another bee joke?\n",
        "No!\n",
        "No one's flying the plane!\n",

        "Where's the pilot?\n",
        "He's unconscious, and so is the copilot.\n",

        "Wait, Barry!\n",
        "We're headed into some lightning.\n",
        "This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing.\n",
        "Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory...\n",
        "That's Barry!\n",
        "...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew.\n",
        "Flowers?!\n",
        "We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience.\n",
        "Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane.\n",
        "I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres.\n",
        "They've done enough damage.\n",
        "But isn't he your only hope?\n",
        "Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all.\n",
        "Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times?\n",
        "\"The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense.\"\n",
        "Get this on the air!\n",
        "Got it.\n",
        "Stand by.\n",
        "We're going live.\n",
        "The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs.\n",
        "But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference.\n",
        "More than we realized. To us, to everyone.\n",
        "That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O.\n",

        "That may have been helping me.\n",
        "And now we're not!\n",
        "So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n",
        "All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out!\n",
        "Move out!\n",
        "Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane!\n",
        "Don't have to yell.\n",
        "I'm not yelling! We're in a lot of trouble.\n",
        "It's very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice!\n",
        "It's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n",
        "I can't do this!\n",
        "Vanessa, pull yourself together. You have to snap out of it!\n",

        "OK.\n",

        "Affirmative!\n",
        "Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n",
        "Land on that flower!\n",

        "Listen, everyone!\n",
        "This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth.\n",
        "That means this is our Last Chance. We're the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers and dress like this.\n",
        "If we're gonna survive as a species, this is our moment! What do you say?\n",
        "Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History keychains?\n",
